STereo Lithography is a file format that was created by 3D Systems
for their STereoLithography CAD software. The file format is currently 
supported by many other software applications and is used to rapidly 
develop rough three-dimensional drafts to be printed via 3D printer. 
STL files are used only to describe the surface structure of a 3D object. 
STL files are described in two file formats: ASCII and binary, both of 
which are fully compatible with most STL software. The difference between 
ASCII and binary are negligible to the user, however, on a storage level 
the ASCII representation takes up to double the amount of storage space 
on a machine versus the binary representation.
